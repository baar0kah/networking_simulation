Network Design and Topology



The network consists of:

\- One router performing inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick)

\- One switch connecting all end devices

\- Nine end devices (PCs and laptops)



Each department is assigned a dedicated VLAN to ensure traffic separation.

The switch connects to the router via a trunk port carrying VLANs 35, 45, and 55.
